17:T5d4,Emotions, at their very basic, are a reaction to external stimuli perceived psychologically and are expressed by our behaviours and/or words (Jarymowicz, 2012). Jarymowicz suggests that emotions can be classified as automatic or uncontrolled emotions and evaluative or reflective emotions which is similar to human regulatory mechanisms which are either impulsive or deliberate. Uncontrolled emotions, as the name suggests, happen within a fraction of a second. A person doesn't really think and arrive at a particular emotional state. For instance, when a subject is scared all of a sudden when s/he isn't expecting anything, then that subject's reaction is an uncontrolled automatic reaction. The subject will feel the emotion of fear. Certain subjects can also react by attacking the opposite person in order to protect themself. Evaluative or deliberate emotions are when a subject has recently moved to a new city and thinks about his/her family. This is the time when the subject will feel sad and might even cry. But in the end, this is deliberate because the subject actually starts thinking about his/her family and starts recalling those lovely moments that s/he has experienced in the past and is missing now. Emotions can also be classified as driving and satisfying or as pleasant and unpleasant (Karla Parussel, 2012; Zhang & Lee, 2009). Driving emotions are the state we want to be in and satisfying emotions are the state we are currently in and want to continue to remain in.18:T429,However, let's assume that computers have been given emotions and they will understand and apply them as humans do. Since computers need to be programmed, initially, computers would need to learn what it is to love, what it is to feel fear and so on and so forth. So now that our computer has learned, we now have an emotionally intelligent computer. This computer knows what it is to love someone. Over a period of time, this computer gets emotionally attached to its user. But how will this computer express its love to the person opposite it? So it checks it's the immense data that it has and finds three words to express love. Unfortunately, it expresses love in a tone that's unique to it — in an unsympathetic unmodulated tone. Do you think a human being will ever take this seriously? As humans, however bad we might be at forming the sentence at that point of time, we are still able to convey our message through our behaviour with that person — non-verbal cues, that is. At the receiving end, we know that a person is genuinely expressing their love.19:T657,But do emotions really affect our decisions? Well, although decision-making is generally considered a rational game, many a time our decisions are affected by our emotions rather sub-consciously (Singh, Jha, & Nair, 2015). And why shouldn't our decisions be affected by our emotions? Emotions help us in knowing what is good and what is bad. Positive emotions attract us into creating such situations again and again. Negative emotions, on the other hand, make us aware of our surroundings and help us survive (Zhang & Lee, 2009). Various studies also back up the fact that reasoning influenced by our emotions yields better (Chrusciel, 2006; Evans, 2004). For instance, when we want to approach another person we try to gauge the opposite person's mood before we start a conversation. This is simply because once we get a fair idea of the opposite person's emotional state, we can strategically put forward our opinions. Let's say we have a very crucial point to be made and the opposite person is in a very good mood. This would be the ideal time when we can talk to the person about it. On the other hand, if the opposite was in a bad mood, we'd rather not talk about anything crucial because there are high chance that our opinions won't be accepted by the opposite person. Interestingly, research has also shown that damage to parts of the brain responsible for emotions actually affects the reasoning abilities of a person and there aren't clear distinguished areas in the brain that are for emotions and reasoning (Bechara, Damasio, Damasio, & Anderson, 1994; Chakraborty & Konar, 2009; Pessoa, 2008; Swanson, 2005).c:[["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"BlogPosting\",\"headline\":\"Should Computers Be Given Emotional Intelligence?\",\"datePublished\":\"2025-01-25T00:00:00.000Z\",\"dateModified\":\"2025-01-25T00:00:00.000Z\",\"description\":\"A philosophical essay\",\"image\":\"/static/posts/aigenbrain.jpg\",\"url\":\"https://blog.clydedsouza.net/posts/should-computers-be-given-emotional-intelligence\",\"author\":[{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Clyde D'Souza\"}]}"}}],["$","section",null,{"className":"mx-auto max-w-7xl px-2 sm:px-6 xl:max-w-7xl xl:px-0","children":[["$","$L15",null,{}],["$","article",null,{"className":"xl:dark:divide-gray-700","children":[["$","$L16",null,{"content":{"title":"Should Computers Be Given Emotional Intelligence?","date":"2025-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["SciFi","Artificial Intelligence","AGI","AI","OpenAI"],"readingList":["Artificial Intelligence"],"lastmod":"2025-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","draft":false,"subtitle":"A philosophical essay","images":["/static/posts/aigenbrain.jpg"],"type":"Blog","readingTime":{"text":"21 min read","minutes":20.355,"time":1221300,"words":4071},"slug":"should-computers-be-given-emotional-intelligence","path":"posts/should-computers-be-given-emotional-intelligence","filePath":"posts/should-computers-be-given-emotional-intelligence.mdx","toc":[{"value":"Introduction","url":"#introduction","depth":3},{"value":"Will computers understand emotions?","url":"#will-computers-understand-emotions","depth":3},{"value":"Will computers make emotional decisions rationally or rational decisions emotionally?","url":"#will-computers-make-emotional-decisions-rationally-or-rational-decisions-emotionally","depth":3},{"value":"In our journey to making computers similar to humans, are we ourselves becoming less human?","url":"#in-our-journey-to-making-computers-similar-to-humans-are-we-ourselves-becoming-less-human","depth":3},{"value":"Conclusion","url":"#conclusion","depth":3},{"value":"References","url":"#references","depth":3}],"structuredData":{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","headline":"Should Computers Be Given Emotional Intelligence?","datePublished":"2025-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","dateModified":"2025-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","description":"A philosophical essay","image":"/static/posts/aigenbrain.jpg","url":"https://blog.clydedsouza.net/posts/should-computers-be-given-emotional-intelligence","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Clyde D'Souza"}]}}}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid-rows-[auto_1fr] pb-8 xl:grid xl:grid-cols-4 xl:gap-x-6","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"pt-2 xl:col-span-3 xl:row-span-2 xl:pb-0","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert max-w-none pb-8","children":[["$","figure",null,{"className":"mb-2","children":[["$","$L7",null,{"src":"/static/posts/aigenbrain.jpg","alt":"Featured photo of a waterfall representing Microsoft Power Automate","className":"mb-0 aspect-16/9 object-cover pb-1","height":536.63,"width":954}],["$","figcaption",null,{"children":["$","center",null,{"children":["Image source: Created using"," ",["$","a",null,{"className":"break-words","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","href":"https://designer.microsoft.com/image-creator?scenario=texttoimage","children":"Microsoft Designer"}]," ","by the author"]}]}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":[["$","strong",null,{"children":"Abstract:"}]," We are all superhumans.

As humans we want this equilibrium to always be maintained for a smooth stress-free life. In dealing with such biological needs, emotions play an adaptive role (LeDoux, 1996; Russell, 2003). For example, we immediately react to reduce the source that is causing pain to us. Psychological homeostasis, on the other hand, is the psychological needs that arise after socialisation (Jarymowicz, 2012). For instance, Jarymowicz explains that social rejection may lead to a negative emotion which then results in some actions by the subject for gratification."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Jarymowicz (2012) also adds that our spontaneous reactions to external stimuli are usually the less deterministic category in terms of the generation of emotions.

We also experience rapid heartbeat and start to perspire. In humans, biologically, it's the amygdala which is responsible for generating emotions (Chakraborty & Konar, 2009).
